# Web Development With Advanced Javascript

#### Description:
> This course provides a comprehensive overview of website development using the modern MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack architecture. Students will create web applications that make use of today's modern JavaScript engine. Other topics may include React, Sass (Syntactically awesome style sheets), and Pug template engine. 


#### Topics:
> This course will take us from an introduction to NodeJS assuming minimal knowledge of Javascript to working with React and Redux frameworks for front end architecture. We will then move from working with front end frameworks toward working with the back end framework Express. With our backend work set up, we will then discuss in relative detail the costs and benefits of using relational databases (e.g. postgres) vs document stores (e.g. mongo).  Finally, we will then combine both front and backend frameworks in one application to create an entire web application, and then break the application into two separate applications to discuss the benefits of micro service architecture. The sequences of topics will be as follows:
- Introduction and Javascript Recap
- NodeJS and ES6
- Npm, scripts, packages
- Tools: Linters, git
- React
- Express
- Front end and Backend Site Building
- Application Deployment
